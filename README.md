# Game-Of-Life-Basic




A basic representation of the 0-player game, "Game-of-Life", a simple example of basic cellular automata.

A cellular automaton is a discrete model of computation studied in automata theory. Cellular automata are also called cellular spaces, tessellation automata, homogeneous structures, cellular structures, tessellation structures, and iterative arrays.<br>

Game-of-Life is a 0-player game which demonstrates this automata concept.<br>

<br>
In newer releases, users can define a basic initial configuration,<br> 
The default rules followed are:<br>
 Less than 2 cells are alive or(in the adjacent 8 cells)<br>
 Greater than 5 cells alive , cell in question dies. <br>
If exactly 3 cells out of the adjacent 8 cells are alive, cell in question will come back to life if it is dead.<br>
Newer releases allow the user to define a different color set for alive/dead cells(rather than the default gray=dead <br>
and white=alive ruleset)- it also allows the user to change the default game of life rules to allow for more pattern variations.
Check the releases section to download the .jar file to run the app.
