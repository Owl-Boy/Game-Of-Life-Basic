A basic representation of the 0-player game, "Game-of-Life", a simple example of basic cellular automata.
Users can now define a basic initial configuration, the rules followed are:<2 cells are alive or>5 cells alive(in the adjacent 8 cells) , cell in question dies. 
If exactly 3 cells out of the adjacent 8 cells are alive, cell in question will come back to life if it is dead.
